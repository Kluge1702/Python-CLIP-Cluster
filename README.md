# Python-CLIP-Cluster
This script performs unsupervised image clustering using OpenAI's CLIP model and DBSCAN. It extracts visual features from all input images, clusters them based on visual similarity, and organizes them into output folders. Images that do not belong to any cluster are labeled as outliers.
